    "A common problem is that powerful models can perfectly fit the data on which they are trained. These models are often <b>low bias</b> and <b>high variance</b> However, we can't observe the variance of a model directly, because we only know how it fits the data we have rather than all potential samples. The goal of supervised learning and the models which we will learn about is to build a model that generalizes. It should accurately predict the future rather than the past.\n",
